# programming-helper-bot
Discord bot to assist general programmers

### Command Prefix
ph!

### External Libraries Needed

**discord.py**

Documentation link: (https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) \
Installation command using pip: `pip install discord.py`

### Notes:
1) Anything you want to know about the bot, launch the bot in your server and use the command `ph!help` for instructions. Create a .env file in the same folder as your main directory and add the bot token there as `TOKEN=<your-bot-token>`
2) This bot is far from complete, don't be an idiot and copy pase this code to launch your own bot. Be a smart contributor and help me fix my bugs.
3) Timestamp: 00:16,10th August, 2020 - will try to complete the bot with advanced error handling and backup/database system in a week.
4) Will update the full info + a proper, well documented README at the end of this week i.e. 00:00, 17th August, 2020.
5) `asyncio` documentation is too damn confusing, I think I'll have to invest more time into it.

### Thanks to:
@Zero5620 for helping me test my bot and giving sound advice on discord bot making process.
